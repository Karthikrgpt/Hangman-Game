Description :-

  Hangman is a popular word-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a hidden word, one letter at 
a time, within a limited number of incorrect guesses. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Rules :-

1 .Word to Guess :-
    
   ->A secret word (usually chosen randomly or predetermined) is selected by the game.
   ->The word is typically represented as a series of underscores (_), 
        where each underscore corresponds to an unguessed letter.

2. Gameplay Mechanics :-

     ->Each time the player guesses a letter:
        ->If the guessed letter is in the word, all instances of the letter are revealed in their correct 
          positions.
        ->If the guessed letter is not in the word, the player loses one "life" or gets one step closer 
          to losing.
    ->The player continues guessing until:
        ->All letters in the word are guessed (player wins), or
        ->The player makes a certain number of incorrect guesses (usually 6, leading to the player losing).
